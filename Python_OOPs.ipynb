        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- OOP is a way of writing programs where we use objects to represent real-life things. Each object has data (variables) and functions or methods.\n",
        "It helps make code reusable, easier to understand, and organized.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class is like a template for creating objects.\n",
        "It defines what data (variables) and actions (methods) an object will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object is an instance of a class. It’s like a copy made from the template.\n",
        "Objects store data and can use the methods defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. what is the Difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction\n",
        "    - Abstraction means hiding the complex details and showing only the necessary features to the user.In example when we use the car, we start the car by the key without paying attention in how the engine works.\n",
        "-Encapsulation\n",
        "    - Encapsulation means binding data and functions together and keeping data safe from direct access. In Python, this is done using private variables (__variable).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods in python are magic methods whose names start and end with double underscores.They are used to perform special operations like object creation or representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "- Inheritance allows a child class to use properties and methods of parent class. It promotes code reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism means “many forms.” It allows one function or method to behave differently based on the object that calls it.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation is achieved by using private and protected variables in a class.in example :- self.__marks(its a private varriable).\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects automatically when they are created. In Python, it is written as __init__().\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Python doesn’t support true method overloading, but it can be achieved by using default arguments or variable-length arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- A property decorator (@property) is used to define getter methods that allow us to access private variables like normal attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism allows flexibility and reusability. It helps in writing code that works with different object types using a common interface — improving scalability and readability of programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is used to define a common interface for subclasses.\n",
        "It is created using the abc module.It import by:-from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- it makes the codes reusable easily.\n",
        "- we secure our data by encapsulation.\n",
        "- It has Polymorphism and inheritance for flexibility.\n",
        "- The maintenance and debbuging get easier by oop.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. 17. Difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        " - Class variable\tInside class but outside methods\tShared by all objects\tcompany_name = \"DEI\"\n",
        "- Instance variable\tInside methods using self\tUnique for each object\tself.name = \"Kartikey\"\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- When a class inherits from more than one parent class, it is called multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python\n",
        "- __str__: Used to return a readable string representation of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  __repr__: Used to return a developer-friendly string (used for debugging).\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "- super() is used in a subclass to call the methods of its parent class. It helps in method overriding and multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- __del__() is a destructor method in Python. It is called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed to free up resources or memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- Definition\n",
        "-              A static method does not take self or cls as a parameter.\n",
        "-\t            A class method takes cls as the first parameter.\n",
        "- Access\n",
        "-           It cannot access class or instance variables directly.\n",
        "-         It can access and modify class variables.\n",
        "- Usage\n",
        "-\t Used for utility functions that do not depend on class data.\n",
        "-      Used when we need to work with class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism allows methods in different classes to have the same name but different behavior.\n",
        "In inheritance, the child class can override the parent class method and give its own version.\n",
        "Python decides which method to call based on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Method chaining means calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line.\n",
        "To achieve this, each method should return self. It makes the code short and readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The __call__() method allows an object to be called like a function.\n",
        "When you use parentheses () after an object, Python automatically calls this method."
